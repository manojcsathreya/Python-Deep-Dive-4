Properties
We saw that we can define "bare" attributes in classes and instances
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, language):
        self.language = language 

obj = MyClass('Python')
print(obj.language)
obj.language = 'Java'
these lines provide direct access to language attribute

In many languages direct access to attributes is highly discouraged
Instead the convention is to make the attribute private, and create public getter and setter methods
Although we don't have private attributes in Python, we could write it this way:
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, language):
        self._language = language
    def get_language(self):
        return self._language
    def set_language(self, value):
        self._language = value 

What code would you rather write?
print(obj.language)
obj.language = 'Java'
or
print(obj.get_language())
obj.set_language('Java')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties 
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, language):
        self._language = language
    def get_language(self):
        return self._language
    def set_language(self, value):
        self._language = value 

In this case, languageis considered an instance property
But is only accessible via the get_language and set_language methods

There are some good reasons why we might want to approach attributes using this programming style

->provides control on how an attribute's value is set and returned

If you start with a class that provides direct access to the language attribute, and later need to 
change it to use accessor methods, you will change the interface of the class
any code that uses the attribute directly: obj.language = 'Java'
will need to be refactored to use 
the accessor methods instead: obj.set_language('Java')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python has a Solution!
We can use the propertyclass to define properties in a class:

class MyClass:
def __init__(self, language):
    self.language = language

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, language):
        self._language = language
    def get_language(self):
        return self._language
    def set_language(self, value):
        self._language = value

    language = property(fget=get_language, fset=set_language)

m = MyClass('Python')
m.language = 'Java'
print(m.language)

->changed an attribute to a property without changing the class interface!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The propertyClass

property is a class (type)
->constructor has a few parameters:
fget  - specifies the function to use to get instance property value
fset  - specifies the function to use to set the instance property value
fdel  - specifies the function to call when deleting the instance property
doc   - a string representing the docstring for the property

In general we start with plain attributes, and if later we need to change to a 
property we can easily do so using the propertyclass without changing the 
interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, language):
        self._language = language
    def get_language(self):
        return self._language
    def set_language(self, value):
        self._language = value

    language = property(fget=get_language, fset=set_language)

m = MyClass('Python') 
m.__dict__ #{'_language': 'Python'}
m.language = 'Java'
m.__dict__ # {'_language': 'Java'}
'language'is not in m.__dict__

Remember how Python looks for attributes:
->searches instance namespace first
->but also looks in class namespace
->finds languagewhich is a property object that has get and set accessors
->uses the accessor methods (how? laterâ€¦)

#Properties
#To be clear, here we are examining instance properties. That is, we define the property in the class we are defining, but the property itself is going to be instance specific, i.e. different instances will support different values for the property. Just like instance attributes. The main difference is that we will use accessor method to get, set (and optionally) delete the associated instance value.

#As I mentioned in the lecture, because properties use the same dotted notation (and the same getattr, setattr and delattr functions), we do not need to start with properties. Often a bare attribute works just fine, and if, later, we decide we need to manage getting/setting/deleting the attribute value, we can switch over to properties without breaking our class interface. This is unlike languages like Java - and hence why in those languages it is recommended to always use getter and setter functions. Not so in Python!

#A property in Python is essentially a class instance - we'll come back to what that class looks like when we study descriptors. For now, we are going to use the property function in Python which is a convenience callable essentially.

#Let's start with a simple example and a bare attribute:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

#So this class has a single instance attribute, name.

p = Person('Alex')
#And we can access and modify that attribute using either dotted notation or the getattr and setattr methods:

p.name
#'Alex'
getattr(p, 'name')
#'Alex'
p.name = 'John'

p.name
#'Alex'
setattr(p, 'name', 'Eric')
p.name
#'Eric'
#Now suppose we wan't to disallow setting an empty string or None for the name. Also, we'll require the name to be a string.

#To do that we are going to create an instance method that will handle the logic and setting of the value. We also create an instance method to retrieve the attribute value.

#We'll use _name as the instance variable to store the name.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.set_name(name)
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self._name
    
    def set_name(self, value):
        if isinstance(value, str) and len(value.strip()) > 0:
            # this is valid
            self._name = value.strip()
        else:
            raise ValueError('name must be a non-empty string')
p = Person('Alex')
try:
    p.set_name(100)
except ValueError as ex:
    print(ex)
#name must be a non-empty string
p.set_name('Eric')
p.get_name()
#'Eric'
#Of course, our users can still manipulate the atribute directly if they want by using the "private" attribute _name. You can't stop anyone from doing this in Python - they should know better than to do that, but we're all good programmers, and know what and what not to do!

#The way we set up our initializer, the validation will work too:

try:
    p = Person('')
except ValueError as ex:
    print(ex)
#name must be a non-empty string
#So this works, but it's a bit of pain to use the method names. So let's turn this into a property instead. We start with the class we just had and tweak it a bit:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # note how we are actually setting the value for name using the property!
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self._name
    
    def set_name(self, value):
        if isinstance(value, str) and len(value.strip()) > 0:
            # this is valid
            self._name = value.strip()
        else:
            raise ValueError('name must be a non-empty string')
            
    name = property(fget=get_name, fset=set_name)
p = Person('Alex')
p.name
#'Alex'
p.name = 'Eric'
try:
    p.name = None
except ValueError as ex:
    print(ex)
#name must be a non-empty string
#So now we have the benefit of using accessor methods, without having to call the methods explicitly.

#In fact, even getattr and setattr will work the same way:

setattr(p, 'name', 'John')  # or p.name = 'John'
getattr(p, 'name')  # or simply p.name
#'John'
#Now let's examine the instance dictionary:

p.__dict__
{'_name': 'John'}
#You'll see we can find the underlying "private" attribute we are using to store the name. But the property itself (name) is not in the dictionary.

#The property was defined in the class:

Person.__dict__

#And you can see it's type is property.

#So when we type p.name or p.name = value, Python recognizes that 'name is a property and therefore uses the accessor methods. (How it does we'll see later when we study descriptors).

#What's interesting is that even if we muck around with the instance dictionary, Python does not get confused - (and as usual in Python, just because you can do something does not mean you should!)

p = Person('Alex')
p.name
#'Alex'
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Alex'}
p.__dict__['name'] = 'John'
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Alex', 'name': 'John'}
#As you can see, we now have name in our instance dictionary.

#Let's retrieve the name via dotted notation:

p.name
#'Alex'
#That's obviously still using the getter method.

#And setting the name:

p.name = 'Raymond'
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Raymond', 'name': 'John'}
#As you can see, it used the setter method.

#And the same thing happens with setattr and getattr:

getattr(p, 'name')
#'Raymond'
setattr(p, 'name', 'Python')
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Python', 'name': 'John'}
#As you can see the setattr method used the property setter.

#For completeness, let's see how the deleter method works:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name
        
    def get_name(self):
        print('getting name')
        return self._name
    
    def set_name(self, value):
        print('setting name')
        self._name = value
        
    def del_name(self):
        print('deleting name')
        del self._name  # or whatever "cleanup" we want to do
        
    name = property(get_name, set_name, del_name)
    
p = Person('Alex')
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Alex'}
p.name
#getting name
#'Alex'
p.name = 'Eric'
#setting name
p.__dict__
#{'_name': 'Eric'}
del p.name
#deleting name
p.__dict__
#{}
#Now, the property still exists (since it is defined in the class) - all we did was remove the underlying value for the property (the _name instance attribute):

try:
    p.name
except AttributeError as ex:
    print(ex)
#getting name
#'Person' object has no attribute '_name'
#As you can see the issue is that the getter function is trying to find _name in the attribute, which no longer exists. So the getter and setter still exist (i.e. the property still exists), so we can still assign to it:

p.name = 'Alex'
#setting name
p.name
#getting name
#'Alex'
#The last param in property is just a docstring. So we could do this:

class Person:
    """This is a Person object"""
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self._name
    
    def set_name(self, value):
        self._name = value
        
    name = property(get_name, set_name, doc="The person's name.")
p = Person('Alex')
